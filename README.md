# vandervelde
This is a repository created for developing the Front-End version of a web-app, commissioned by Vandervelde Protection.

The HTML code is documented. The documentation contains explanations as well as relevant SQL code. The SQL code is written for the
Interbase file 'Allinco.db'. This file contains all data for Multivers which the applicaton should eventually be connected with.
